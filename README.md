# WittenBnB
C# project

## Purpose
For the September 2017 C#/.NET course through CodeLouisville, this project is a bed and breakfast reservation management system with basic CRUD operations, and is intended to be seen as an internal (employee-facing) application for a fictitious bed and breakfast service, WittenBnB. Guest names and phone numbers were randomly generated.

## How to run
Download the repository and open the 'WittenBnB.sln' file in the top level of the folder in Visual Studio (preferably VS 2017). Once opened, right-click on the project solution and click Restore NuGet Packages. Open the Nuget Package Console and run the 'Update-Database' command. Afterwards, compile and run the app. When you click on the "View Reservations" link, you should see a list of reservations that were generated from the seed data. Create, update, and delete functions should also work.
