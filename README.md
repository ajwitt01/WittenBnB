# WittenBnB
C# project

## Purpose
For the September 2017 C#/.NET course through CodeLouisville, this project is a bed and breakfast reservation management system with basic CRUD operations, and is intended to be seen as an internal (employee-facing) application for a fictitious bed and breakfast service, WittenBnB. Guest names and phone numbers were randomly generated.
